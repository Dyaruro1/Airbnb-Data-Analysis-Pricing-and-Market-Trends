# 🏠 Airbnb Data Analysis: Pricing and Market Trends

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings to identify key factors influencing pricing and market trends across different neighborhoods. Using **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, we explore price distribution, location-based trends, and availability patterns.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Price Distribution:** Analyzed average, median, and identified outliers.
- **Neighborhood Analysis:** Compared the most and least expensive neighborhoods.
- **Property Type Impact:** Examined how different accommodation types influence pricing.
- **Availability & Demand:** Investigated how booking frequency relates to pricing strategies.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Operations:** Data Cleaning, Transformation, Visualization

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), containing real-world listings from various cities. Data includes information on price, location, property type, availability, and more.

## 📈 Visualizations
- Histograms for price distribution
- Bar charts for neighborhood comparisons
- Scatter plots showing price vs. number of rooms
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis

## 🚀 Next Steps
Future improvements could include:
- **Machine Learning Models:** Predictive modeling for pricing optimization.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualization using Streamlit or Plotly for deeper insights.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping Airbnb listings to explore geographic trends.
